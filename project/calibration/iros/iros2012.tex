referred to as \texttt{centroidRANSAC()} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:sketch}, provides a rough estimate of the transform which serves as a reasonable starting point for ICP.  To accomplish this, we first 

This methods assumes that objects are we first assume that NTP or similar methods can provide synchronization to within about 100ms.

However, naively running ICP on entire frames can result in very poor alignments, an example of which can be seen in Figure \todo{x}.  This is because ICP rewards transforms in which many points are nearby, and floors often have more observed points on them than the people or robots walking on them.  However, running ICP on just these foreground prevents this problem.

\section{EXPERIMENTS}
TODO
%TODO@SDM Write

To keep the amount of data manageable but still produce a good result, we used between about thirty and ten percent of the total frames in each sequence, sampling chunks of consecutive frames to allow synchronization search to work.

Because of the availability of NTP, approximate synchronization of the sensors is possible across multiple machines.  However, NTP alone does not provide sufficient precision for aligning 30fps RBGD data, where offsets tens of milliseconds are significant.


sensors do not trigger at the same time, leading to unavoidable synchronization slop that we do not address.
