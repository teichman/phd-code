  <description brief="openni2">

    You'll need to install the following:
      sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
    ... and probably a few other things of which I'm not aware.
    'apt-file find' is your friend.
    
    Once this package has been built, you must run
      make install
    to install udev rules.

    If it dies complaining about java, you probably don't even need that part.
