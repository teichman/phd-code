  <description brief="maxflow">

     This package is a simple downloader for the Max-flow/min-cut code from Yuri Boykov and Olga Veksler available at http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/.  If you use their code in an academic work, you should cite their paper:

     "An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy Minimization in Vision."
     Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov.
     In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI),
     September 2004
                                     
     Please note this code is not BSD.  From the readme:
     
     "This software can be used for research purposes only.
     If you require another license, you may consider using version 2.21
     (which implements exactly the same algorithm, but does not have the option of reusing search trees)."
     
     For license details, see the README.TXT available in the build/ directory after making this package.
