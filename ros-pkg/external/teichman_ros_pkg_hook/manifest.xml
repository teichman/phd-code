  <description brief="teichman_ros_pkg_hook">

    This is a placeholder package which all teichman-ros-pkg packages depend on.  If you're using teichman-ros-pkg as an external repository, (A) depends on eigen_extensions, and you rosmake (A), you want teichman-ros-pkg to automatically get checked out.  Replacing this package with a custom Makefile can help.
