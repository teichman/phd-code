     See
     https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI
     and
     https://github.com/PrimeSense/Sensor
     for install notes if necessary.
     
     You'll need to have at least these packages installed, and possibly more:
     openjdk-7-jdk
     libusb-1.0.0-dev

     You'll need to make install this package before you can actually run anything that uses a depth sensor.  This is because of, among many other things, the USB rules that are required on the system for a sensor to work.  make install is not done by default so as to not touch anything on your system unless you explicitly tell it to.
